**This document discusses Trailblazer 2.1.** An overview about the additions are [on our website](http://trailblazer.to/blog/2017-12-trailblazer-2-1-what-you-need-to-know.html).

The [1.x documentation is here](http://trailblazer.to/gems/operation/1.1/).

## Trailblazer In A Nutshell

1. All business logic is encapsulated in [operations](#operation) (service objects).
  * Optional [validation objects](#validation) (Reform and/or Dry-validation) in the operation deserialize and validate input. The form object can also be used for rendering.
  * An optional [policy](#policies) object blocks unauthorized users from running the operation.
  * Optional [callback](#callbacks) objects allow declaring post-processing logic.
3. [Controllers](#controllers) instantly delegate to an operation. No business code in controllers, only HTTP-specific logic.
4. [Models](#models) are persistence-only and solely define associations and scopes. No business code is to be found here. No validations, no callbacks.
5. The presentation layer offers optional [view models](#views) (Cells) and [representers](#representers) for document APIs.

Trailblazer is designed to handle different contexts like user roles by applying [inheritance](#inheritance) between and [composing](#composing) of operations, form objects, policies, representers and callbacks.

## Trailblazer Gem Ecosystem
_**You are free to use any part of the system by itself, but Trailblazer really shines, when all parts work together.**_ 

### Core
* [Trailblazer](https://github.com/apotonick/trailblazer) - Service Objects layer. Orchestrates your Rails / Sinatra / Padrino / Roda / Etc. application's business logic and coordinates interaction with other gems. 
* [Reform](https://github.com/apotonick/reform) - Form Object layer. Reform gives you a form object with validations and nested setup of models. It is completely framework-agnostic and doesn't care about your database or ORM layer. Can be used with ActiveRecord, Monogoid, etc
* [Roar](https://github.com/apotonick/roar) - REST document representation layer.  Roar comes with built-in JSON, JSON-HAL, JSON-API and XML support. Its highly modular architecture provides features like coercion, hypermedia, HTTP transport, client caching and more.
* [Cells](https://github.com/apotonick/cells) - ViewModels layer. View Layer OOP style. 

### Extras
* [Cells Kaminari](https://github.com/apotonick/kaminari-cells) - pagination for Cells. 
* [Apotomo](https://github.com/apotonick/apotomo) - UX layer, based on Cells. It gives you widgets and encapsulation, bubbling events, AJAX page updates, rock-solid testing and more. Check out [http://apotomo.de](http://apotomo.de) for more information.
* [Tyrant](https://github.com/apotonick/tyrant) - Authentication for Trailblazer, Trailblazer-style. You are free to use your favorite authentication gem instead, such as AuthLogic. 
* [Paperdragon](https://github.com/apotonick/paperdragon) - Explicit image processing based on Dragonfly with Paperclip compatibility.

### Building Blocks
* [Representable](https://github.com/apotonick/representable) - handles all the nitty-gritty details for Roar.
* [Disposable](https://github.com/apotonick/disposable) - Decorator on top of your ORM. This is the main building block for Reform and Trailblazer.
* [Declarative](https://github.com/apotonick/declarative) - allows declaring nested schemas. This is a building block for other components.
* [Hooks](https://github.com/apotonick/hooks) - Generic hooks with callbacks for Ruby. This is a building block for  Apotomo.

## Mission

While _Trailblazer_ offers you abstraction layers for all aspects of Ruby On Rails, it does _not_ missionize you. Wherever you want, you may fall back to the "Rails Way" with fat models, monolithic controllers, global helpers, etc. This is not a bad thing, but allows you to step-wise introduce Trailblazer's encapsulation in your app without having to rewrite it.

Trailblazer is all about structure. It helps re-organize existing code into smaller components where different concerns are handled in separated classes.

Again, you can pick which layers you want. Trailblazer doesn't impose technical implementations, it offers mature solutions for recurring problems in all types of Rails applications.

Trailblazer is no "complex web of objects and indirection". It solves many problems that have been around for years with a cleanly layered architecture. Only use what you like. And that's the bottom line.

## Concepts over Technology

Trailblazer offers you a new, more intuitive file layout in applications.

```
app
├── concepts
│   ├── comment
│   │   ├── operation
│   │   │   ├── create.rb
│   │   │   ├── update.rb
│   │   ├── contract
│   │   │   ├── create.rb
│   │   │   ├── update.rb
│   │   ├── cell
│   │   │   ├── show.rb
│   │   │   ├── index.rb
│   │   ├── view
│   │   │   ├── show.haml
│   │   │   ├── index.rb
│   │   │   ├── comment.css.sass
```

Instead of grouping by technology, classes and views are structured by *concept*, and then by technology. A concept can relate to a model, or can be a completely abstract concern such as `invoicing`.

Within a concept, you can have any level of nesting. For example, `invoicing/pdf/` could be one.

The file structure is implemented by the [`trailblazer-loader` gem](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-loader).

## Architecture

Trailblazer extends the conventional MVC stack in Rails. Keep in mind that adding layers doesn't necessarily mean adding more code and complexity.

The opposite is the case: Controller, view and model become lean endpoints for HTTP, rendering and persistence. Redundant code gets eliminated by putting very little application code into the right layer.

![The Trailblazer stack.](https://raw.github.com/apotonick/trailblazer/master/doc/operation-2017.png)

## Routing

Trailblazer uses Rails routing to map URLs to controllers, because it works.

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :comments
end
```

## Controllers

Controllers are lean endpoints for HTTP. They do not contain any business logic. Actions immediately dispatch to an operation.

```ruby
class CommentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    run Comment::Create # Comment::Create is an operation class.
  end
end
```

The `#run` method invokes the operation. It allows you to run a conditional block of logic if the operation was successful.

```ruby
class CommentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    run Comment::Create do |op|
      return redirect_to(comment_path op.model) # success!
    end

    render :new # invalid. re-render form.
  end
end
```

Again, the controller only dispatchs to the operation and handles successful/invalid processing on the HTTP level. For instance by redirecting, setting flash messages, or signing in a user.

## Operation

Operations encapsulate business logic and are the heart of a Trailblazer architecture.

The bare bones operation without any Trailblazery is implemented in [the `trailblazer-operation` gem](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-operation) and can be used without our stack.

Operations don't know about HTTP or the environment. You could use an operation in Rails, Hanami, or Roda, it wouldn't know.

An operation is not just a monolithic replacement for your business code. It's a simple orchestrator between the form objects, models, your business code and all other layers needed to get the job done.

```ruby
class Comment::Create < Trailblazer::Operation
  step :process!

  def process!(options)
    # do whatever you feel like.
  end
end
```

Operations only need to define and implement steps, like the `#process!` steps. Those steps receive the arguments from the caller.

You cannot instantiate them per design. The only way to invoke them is `call`.

```ruby
Comment::Create.call(whatever: "goes", in: "here")
# same as
Comment::Create.(whatever: "goes", in: "here")
```

Their high degree of encapsulation makes them a [replacement for test factories](#test), too.

## Validation

In Trailblazer, an operation (usually) has a form object which is simply a `Reform::Form` class. All the [API documented in Reform](https://github.com/apotonick/reform) can be applied and used.

Validations can also be implemented in pure Dry-validation.

The operation makes use of the form object using the `#validate` method.

```ruby
class Comment::Create < Trailblazer::Operation
  extend Contract::DSL

  contract do
    # this is a Reform::Form class!
    property :body, validates: {presence: true}
  end

  step Model( Comment, :new )
  step Contract::Build()
  step Contract::Validate( key: :comment )
  step Contract::Persist( )
end
```

The contract (aka _form_) is defined in the `::contract` block. You can implement nested forms, default values, validations, and everything else Reform provides.

In the `#process` method you can define your business logic.

[Learn more.](http://trailblazer.to/gems/operation/2.0/contract.html)

## Models

Models for persistence can be implemented using any ORM you fancy, for instance [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord#active-record--object-relational-mapping-in-rails) or [Datamapper](http://datamapper.org/).

In Trailblazer, models are completely empty. They solely contain associations and finders. No business logic is allowed in models.

```ruby
class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :thing

  scope :latest, lambda { all.limit(9).order("id DESC") }
end
```

Only operations and views/cells can access models directly.

## Policies

You can abort running an operation using a policy. "[Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit)-style" policy classes define the rules.

```ruby
class Comment::Policy
  def initialize(user, comment)
    @user, @comment = user, comment
  end

  def create?
    @user.admin?
  end
end
```

The rule is enabled via the `::policy` call.

```ruby
class Comment::Create < Trailblazer::Operation
  step Policy( Comment::Policy, :create? )
end
```

The policy is evaluated in `#setup!`, raises an exception if `false` and suppresses running `#process`.

## Views

View rendering can happen using the controller as known from Rails. This is absolutely fine for simple views.

More complex UI logic happens in _View Models_ as found in [Cells](https://github.com/apotonick/cells). View models also replace helpers.

The operation's form object can be rendered in views, too.

```ruby
class CommentsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    form Comment::Create # will assign the form object to @form.
  end
end
```

Since Reform objects can be passed to form builders, you can use the operation to render and process the form!

```haml
= simple_form_for @form do |f|
  = f.input :body
```


## Representers

Operations can use representers from [Roar](https://github.com/apotonick/roar) to serialize and parse JSON and XML documents for APIs.

Representers can be inferred automatically from your contract, then may be refined, e.g. with hypermedia or a format like `JSON-API`.

```ruby
class Comment::Create < Trailblazer::Operation
  representer do
    # inherited :body
    include Roar::JSON::HAL

    link(:self) { comment_path(represented.id) }
  end
end
```

The operation can then parse incoming JSON documents in `validate` and render a document via `to_json`.

## Tests

In Trailblazer, you only have operation unit tests and integration smoke tests to test the operation/controller wiring.

Operations completely replace the need for leaky factories.

```ruby
describe Comment::Update do
  let(:comment) { Comment::Create.(comment: {body: "[That](http://trailblazer.to)!"}) }
end
```

## More

Trailblazer has many more architectural features such as

* Polymorphic builders and operations
* Inheritance and composition support
* Polymorphic views

Check the project website and the book.

## Installation

The obvious needs to be in your `Gemfile`.

```ruby
gem "trailblazer"
gem "trailblazer-rails" # if you are in rails.
gem "trailblazer-cells"
```

Cells is _not_ required per default! Add it if you use it, which is highly recommended.
